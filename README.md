Insights derived from the analysis
1. Who are the top loyal customers of CrossBorder Films and where do they live?
This includes the address, city and country the customers are from, limited to just 10 customers. Two of these loyal customers live in the United States.

2. Give a report of rental performance. How many films were returned late, early and on time?

3: What are the top rented (highest in demand) genres of film and what are their total sales?

Sports category is the highest in demand in all the genre available. This is to inform the rental agency to make sure they don't run out of sports category DVDs. Followed by sports is sci-fi and animation category.

4: Identify the countries where CrossBorder Films had the highest volume of sales along-side the countries where they had the largest customer base.
